adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
 practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy./Most web browsers

 Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law

responsive action, should a data breach occur: </p><ul><li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days.</li><li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day</li></ul> <p>We
 also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that 
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against 
data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This 
principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights 
against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
 government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by 
data processors.</p> <h3>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3> <p>We do not 
use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. We only 
provide articles and information. We never ask for credit card numbers. 
We use regular Malware Scanning.</p> <p>Your personal information is 
contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited 
number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and 
are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all 
sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket 
Layer (SSL) technology.</p> <p>We implement a variety of security 
measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their 
information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p> <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p> <h3>POLLFISH</h3> <i> <p>This
